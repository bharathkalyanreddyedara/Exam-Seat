This web application automates the process of arranging seating for exams, aimed at making the seating arrangement process more efficient and reducing errors.
The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend is developed with React.js.
The application stores seating data in a MySQL database.
The platform provides a user-friendly interface for exam coordinators to dynamically allocate seating based on inputs.

To run the project locally, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Install any necessary dependencies for both the backend and frontend.
The main file to be opened with Live Server is index.html, which can be found in the static branch.
Make sure the backend (React.js app) is running, and then open the index.html file in Live Server to view the app and interact with the seating arrangements.
